* P - [Understanding the] Problem

Problem: Write a method that takes a year as input and returns the century. The return value should be a string that begins with the century number, and ends with st, nd, rd, or th as appropriate for that number. New centuries begin in years that end with `01`. So, the years 1901-2000 comprise the 20th century.

input: Integer
output: String
rules:
        - Explicit Requirements:
          - Method takes a year as input and returns the century
          - Return value should be a string that begins with century number
          - Return value should be a string that ends with:
            - st -->  1st
            - nd --> 2nd
            - rd --> 3rd
            - th --> 4th
          - New centuries begin in years that end with `01`

        - Implicit Requirements:
          - The input will need to be converted to a mutable object, i.e., String
          - The number of digits in the input will be a factor in determining the century

        - Clarifying Questions:
          - Are we saying that any year ending with `01` is a new century?
