* P - [Understanding the] Problem

Problem: Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer greater than 0, then asks if the user wants to determine the sum or product of all numbers between 1 and the entered integer.

input: string
output: string
rules:
        - Explicit Requirements:
          - Ask the user to enter an integer greater than 0
          - Ask if the user wants to determine the sum or product of all numbers between 1 and the entered integer

        - Implicit Requirements:
          - Input (string) needs to be converted to integer

        - Clarifying Questions:
          - Do we need to check for input validation?

* E - Examples / Test Cases

>> Please enter an integer greater than 0:
5
>> Enter 's' to compute the sum, 'p' to compute the product. 
s
The sum of the integers between 1 and 5 is 15.
