* P - [Understand the] Problem

PROBLEM:

Write a method that takes a positive integer, n, as an argument, and displays a right triangle whose sides each have n stars. The hypotenuse of the triangle (the diagonal side in the images below)should have one end at the lower-left of the triangle, and the other end at the upper-right.

- input: integer
- output: string
- rules:
        Explicit Requirements:
        - method takes a positive integer, n, as an argument
        - displays a right triangle whose "sides" each have "n" stars
        - hypotenuse of the triangle (diagonal side) should have:
          - one end at the lower-left of the triangle
          - other end at the upper-right

        Implicit Requirements:
        - integer must be positive
        - integer represents:
          - total row count
          - count of stars in the first row
