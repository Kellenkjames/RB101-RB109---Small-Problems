* P - [Understanding the] Problem

Problem: Given a string that consists of some words (all lowercased) and an assortment of non-alphabetic characters, write a method that returns that string with all of the non-alphabetic characters replaced by spaces.

If one or more non-alphabetic characters occur in a row, you should only have one space in the result (the result should never have consecutive spaces).

input: String
output: String (new object)
rules:
        - Explicit Requirements:
          - Method will return a String with all of the non-alphabetic characters replaced by spaces
          - If one or more non-alphabetic characters occur in a row - you will have "one" space in the result
          
        - Implicit Requirements:
          - The result should never have consecutive spaces

        - Clarifying Questions:
          - N / A
